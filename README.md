# Howdy

Howdy is a discord bot that is constantly being worked on. Its objective is to create one simple, do-it-all bot.

`index.js` is the main file.

Node.js 12.0.0 or newer is required.

You need to install discord.js in this directory by typing `npm install discord.js` in the CLI.

You also need to add a `config.json` file which contains the token and prefix, like this:

`{ "prefix": "(place your prefix here)", "token": "(place your bot's token here)" }`

The bot can be run by locating the directory and typing `node .`
